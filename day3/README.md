The HTML code is the same from day2, I'm just styling the same.

1. I have added classes to the h1, h2 and h3 heading and a div class to the unordered list in index.html file.

2. Then Created an style.css and liked that file to all the html files externally.

3. I have added a background-color and adjusted the body width to 50%, line-hieght to 140% and font-family to Verdana, sans-serif.

4. Then Adjusted the width of the images to 400px which will be applied to all the images in the website.

5. With the class selector I have colored the headings.

6. Removed the link underlines with text-decoration.
