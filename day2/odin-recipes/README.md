Step-1: Initial structure

1. Within the odin-recipes directory i have created an index.html file.
2. Filled it with the usual boilerplate HTML and added an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

Step-2: Recipe page

1. Created a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and named it as recipes.
2. Created a new HTML file within the recipes directory and named it after the recipe it contains. For example lasagna.html.
3. Included an <h1> heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
4. Back in the index.html file in odin-recipes directory, added a link to the recipe page which I have created using a link tag <a>.

Step-3: Recipe page content

The new recipe page has the following content:

1. An image of the finished dish under the <h1> heading that I added earlier and adjusted the width and height of the image under the image tag <img>
2. Under the image, I have added an heading “Description” with <h2> followed by a paragraph <p> describing the recipe.
3. Under the description, I added an heading “Ingredients” with <h2> which is followed by an unordered list <ul> of the ingredients needed for the recipe.
4. And finally, under the ingredients list, I added an heading “Steps” with <h2> which is again followed by an ordered list <ol> for the steps needed for making the dish.

Step-4: Added 2 more recipes

1. I have added two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe pages.
2. And linked the new recipes to index page. The links of the recipe page are arranged in an unordered list <ul> so that they can be different line as point.
