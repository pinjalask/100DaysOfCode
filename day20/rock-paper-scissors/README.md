# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game - JavaScript Implementation

This project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in JavaScript using functions and if-else statements. The program features a best-of-five game-play mode, allowing the player to compete against the computer. This is a updated project of Rock, Paper, Scissors Game from day 17 of my 100DaysOfCode challenge. I've included loop for playing multiple rounds and keeping the track of the score for deciding the final winner.

## Overview

### The Rock, Paper, Scissors game demonstrates the usage of:

- Functions for modular code and reusability.
- Looping (for loop) for implementing multiple rounds.
- Conditionals (if-else) to evaluate game logic.
- String methods for user input validation and case handling.

### How It Works

- The computer's choice is randomly generated by the getComputerChoice() function.
- The human's choice is obtained from user input via the prompt() method and validated in the getHumanChoice() function.
- The playRound() function compares the choices to determine the outcome of each round:
  "win" if the player wins.
  "lose" if the computer wins.
  "draw" if both selections are the same.
- The playGame() function runs a best-of-five match:
  Tracks scores for both the player and computer.
  Displays the result after each round.
  Declares the overall winner or a tie at the end of the game.

### Code Explanation

1. Computer Choice

The getComputerChoice() function uses Math.random() to randomly pick one of the three options:

    "rock" if the random number is between 0 and 0.33.
    "paper" if the random number is between 0.34 and 0.66.
    "scissors" for numbers above 0.66.

2. Human Choice

The getHumanChoice() function prompts the player to input their choice and converts it to lowercase for case-insensitive comparisons:

3. Single Round Logic

The playRound() function determines the result of a single round by comparing the player's choice with the computer's:

    Win conditions:
        Rock beats Scissors.
        Paper beats Rock.
        Scissors beat Paper.
    Lose conditions are the reverse.
    If the choices match, it's a draw.

4. Gameplay Loop

The playGame() function:

    Initializes scores for the player and computer.
    Loops through 5 rounds, displaying the results of each round and updating the scores.
    After the loop:
        Displays the final score.
        Declares the winner or a tie.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, the following JavaScript concepts were practiced:

- **Functions:** Modular design with reusable functions like getComputerChoice(), getHumanChoice(), playRound(), and playGame().
- **Loops:** Using for loops to repeat actions (5 rounds in this case).
- **Conditional Statements:** Implementing game logic with if-else.
- **String Methods:** Using .toLowerCase() for input standardization.
- **Math.random():** Generating random numbers for computer decisions.
- **Debugging:** Leveraging console.log() to debug and display results.

This implementation is a great introduction to combining user input, randomness, and conditional logic to create an interactive program.
