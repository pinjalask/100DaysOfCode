This project is a Basic Calculator implemented using only HTML, JavaScript variables, and strings. It provides basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program handles user input through buttons and dynamically updates the calculation string, which is evaluated to display the result.

This project is the updated version of the Basic Calculator project, which I did on day 20. I've added a function, updateCalculation(value). This includes the variable declaration and input appending. Called the function in each button by giving the value.
