# Cart Quantity Management with JavaScript

This project demonstrates a basic cart quantity management system implemented using HTML, JavaScript variables, and strings. It allows users to manage the quantity of items in a cart, ensuring the quantity remains within valid limits (0 to 10). The program provides real-time feedback using the browser's console and alerts.

This project is the updated version of Cart Quantity Management, which I did on day 21. I have used a function, updateCartQuantity(), for maintaining a clean and effective code and used it for all the buttons.

I've used if statements for maintaining the maximum(10) and minimum(0) capacity items in the cart.
